- [ ] scan the codebase for architecture improvements
- [ ] auto sort content by category tags?
- [ ] key people etc should be a part of it? What other valuable metadata can we extract from it?
- [ ] allow file renaming (in the history section)

- In the Metadata Explorer page, what should happen is the moment I select an option or a tag: it should automatically filter what's left on the basis of that selection.

- [ ] Increase the target area of the checkboxes. I need to be very precise currently.
- [ ] When files get deleted, the indexing & associations based on the connections should be updated. Also, when new files are created, the related tab on the right-hand pane should have an "Update Index" button. In fact, there should always be an "Update Index" button, just in case it's out of date.

- [ ] Generated idea should have a different tile color. Also, I should be able to switch between summaries and generated connections. What should we call this?
- [ ] I should not be able to click out while I am analyzing a particular file. It should give me a discard modal warning.
- [ ] How can we create a graph, sort of a network graph for connected ideas, similar to what we have in the related view?

- [ ] Split up Ask LLM floating bar into two buttons: - [ ] One is custom question (this opens up a modal where a user can ask their own question, have a preset text 'elaborate on this') - [ ] The other is elaborate based on the context, (which is what it does right now)
      In both cases, it should populate in the same place where it is populating right now, which is the notes section in the right side bar.

- [ ] What libraries can be used to simplify some of our work here, like querying things like regex, etc.? I feel these can be quite fragile. What about other things that we can simplify by implementing libraries that are lightweight?
- There should be a clear filters button options Meta Data Explorer page. Perhaps the top right of each category section saying "reset"

- Add favorites
